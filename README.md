# Rhine levels and how they affect the shipping traffic

For my Ironhack midterm project I choose to work on the water levels of the Rhine - the river running through my hometown Cologne. Levels has dropped tremendously in summer in the last years, and time and again the complete shipping traffic came to a halt. In this project I wanted to investigate, how often this is the case and whether it was really increasing in the last year or wheather it was just my own impression. 

I used data from [open.nrw](https://open.nrw/) the open data website from Nord Rhine-Westphalia. Here is a link to the used data: [Rhine levels](https://open.nrw/dataset/tagliche-wasserstande-des-rheins-bei-dusseldorf-in-den-monaten-seit-1996-d)

Grafics were built with Tableau. Here is a [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rebecca6543/viz/week5_project2/Dashboard1?publish=yes) to the Tableau Public Dashboard.
